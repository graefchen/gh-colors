# gh-colors

A simple website to show the colors a language uses in github.
Inspired by the the great [github-colors](https://github.com/ozh/github-colors) project from [ozh](https://github.com/ozh).

## Rewrite:

After the rewrite it should look a little bit more like [mason-registry](https://mason-registry.dev/registry/list)

## implemented

- searching for a language & show it's used color
- the hexcode of the color
- more informations about the language
